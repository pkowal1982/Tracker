**[Tracker](https://pkowal1982.itch.io/deep-space-immersion)**
is application which enables you to check
**[Godot Engine's](https://godotengine.org)** tracking module.  

For now full potential of tracking head using webcam can be seen in
**[Deep Space Immersion](https://pkowal1982.itch.io/deep-space-immersion)**
but only on Linux.  

**[Tracker](https://pkowal1982.itch.io/deep-space-immersion)**
processes single images but works also on Windows,
so you can give it a try even if you are a poor student and
can't afford Linux operating system.  

Take a screenshot with a marker attached to your head and
check if it can be found by **[Tracker](https://pkowal1982.itch.io/deep-space-immersion)**.
To get the executable scroll down to the download section.
